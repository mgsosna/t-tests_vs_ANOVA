# Visualizing the danger of multiple t-test comparisons
## Background
Many research questions involve comparing experimental groups to one another. Is the average height of men in Norway taller than men in Sweden? Does tumor size decrease in patients that receive the treatment versus a placebo? 


A commonly-used method for comparing two groups is the [t-test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-test).
